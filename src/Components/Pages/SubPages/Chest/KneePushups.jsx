          <h1>Knee Push-Ups</h1>
          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <p>
          To perform knee push-ups, start by kneeling on the floor with your knees hip-width apart and your toes pointed behind you. Place your hands on the floor slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, ensuring your wrists are aligned with your shoulders. Engage your core and keep your body in a straight line from your head to your knees. Lower your body towards the floor by bending your elbows, keeping them at about a 45-degree angle to your body. Lower yourself until your chest is just above the ground. Pause briefly, then push through your palms to return to the starting position, fully extending your arms. Aim for 3 sets of 8-12 reps, adjusting as necessary based on your fitness level.
