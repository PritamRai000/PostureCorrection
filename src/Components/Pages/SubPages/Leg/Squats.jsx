          <h1>Squats</h1>
          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <p>
          To perform squats, begin by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes slightly pointed out. Engage your core muscles to maintain stability throughout the movement. Lower your body by bending your knees and pushing your hips back as if sitting in a chair, ensuring your chest remains up and your back stays straight. Aim to lower your thighs until they are parallel to the ground or as low as comfortable, pausing briefly at the lowest point to ensure your knees are aligned with your toes. Press through your heels to return to the starting position, keeping your core engaged and chest up. Start with 3 sets of 10-15 reps, adjusting as needed based on your fitness level.
          </p>
