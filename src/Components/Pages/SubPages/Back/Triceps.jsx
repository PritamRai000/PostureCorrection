          <h1>Triceps Dips</h1>
          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <p>
          To perform triceps dips, start by sitting on the edge of a sturdy bench or chair, placing your hands next to your hips with fingers pointing forward. Slide your buttocks off the edge, supporting your weight with your arms while keeping your legs extended in front of you. Engage your core and keep your shoulders down and back. Lower your body by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your sides, until your upper arms are parallel to the ground or slightly below. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push through your palms to return to the starting position, fully extending your arms. Aim for 3 sets of 8-12 reps, adjusting as necessary based on your fitness level.
