          <h1>Dumbell Lateral Raises</h1>
          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <p>
            To perform dumbbell lateral raises, stand with your feet
            shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides
            with your palms facing your body and elbows slightly bent. Engage
            your core to maintain stability, then slowly raise the dumbbells out
            to the sides until your arms are parallel to the floor or slightly
            below shoulder level, keeping the movement controlled and avoiding
            any swinging. Your palms should face downward at the top of the
            lift. Gradually lower the dumbbells back to the starting position,
            ensuring a smooth descent. Aim for 10-15 repetitions for 2-3 sets,
            resting for 30-60 seconds between sets. Start with lighter weights
            to focus on form, and always warm up before your workout to prevent
            injuries.
